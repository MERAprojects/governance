OpenHalon Project Leader
========================

The OpenHalon Project Leader (OPL) is ultimately responsible for the success
of the OpenHalon project, and leads the team driving towards each OpenHalon
release. The OPL works closely with the Release Manager and the committers
to ensure a consistent vision for the project is met with each release.
Any technical disputes are settled by the OPL if they cannot be settled in
another manner.
