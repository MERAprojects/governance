OpenHalon Project Leader
========================

The OpenHalon Project Leader (OPL) is ultimately responsible for the success
of the OpenHalon project, and leads the team driving towards each OpenHalon
release. The broad technical vision for the success of OpenHalon is the
responsibilty of the entire community, but the OPL is the one who must lead
the community in a common direction towards a goal the community has chosen
and feels is important.

The OPL works closely with the Release Manager and the maintainers to ensure a
consistent vision for the project is met with each release. Any technical
disputes are settled by the OPL if they cannot be settled in another manner.

In addition, the OPL is responsible for growing new leaders in the project.
These include maintainers as well as committers. A healthy project is one
in which a pipeline of future talent is constantly being readied.

The initial OPL will be selected by HP.
