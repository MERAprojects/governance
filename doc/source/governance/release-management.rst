OpenHalon Release Management
============================

The OpenHalon project has an overall release manager. This person is charge
of handling the items related to the overall release of OpenHalon. OpenHalon
strives to have releases which are as bug free as possible and deliver on
stability and quality, with additional features added as the community seeks
to add them. The release manager coordinates all of this work across the
OpenHalon project.

The initial release manager will be assigned by HP.
