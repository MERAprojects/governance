OpenSwitch Committers
=====================

Projects in OpenSwitch are made up of many different forms of contributors.
One specific example is a committer. A committer has the ability to merge
code into the OpenSwitch project for which they are a member. Committers
responsibilities are outlined below. In general, projects should strive to
have a healthy number of committers to ensure code is merged in a timely
manner and the project is moving forward with decent feature velocity.
There are no hard numbers of how many committers are required, but as the
committers work closely together, experience in other projects has led us
to believe they usually top out at 12-15 or so per project before requiring
another layer in between the maintainer and committers.

Code Merge Responsibilities
===========================

While everyone is encouraged to review changes for OpenSwitch repositories,
OpenSwitch committers have the ability to +2/-2 and +A changes to these
repositories. This is an extra level of responsibility not to be taken
lightly. Correctly merging code requires not only understanding the code
itself, but also how the code affects things like documentation, testing,
and interactions with other projects. It also means you pay attention to
release milestones and understand if a patch you're merging is marked for
the release, especially critical during the feature freeze near a release.

The bottom line here is merging code is a responsibility for all OpenSwitch
committers.

Adding or Removing Committers
-----------------------------

A new OpenSwitch committer may be proposed at anytime on the openswitch-dev
mailing list. Typically, the existing committer team for a project will
propose a new member after discussions with the existing committers. Once
a proposal has been made, three existing OpenSwitch committers must respond
to the email with a +1.  If the member is being added to a committer team
with less than three members, a simple majority will be used to determine if
the vote is successful. Another OpenSwitch committer can vote -1 to veto the
proposed new OpenSwitch committer.

Removal of an OpenSwitch committer can happen after consultation with the
existing committers. Typically, if someone is no longer involved in working
on code in a specific repository, it is natural for that person to ask for
themselves to be removed. However, if the person has either lost contact
with the existing committers, or the existing committers determine the
person should no longer have committer rights, either the OpenSwitch project
leader or the maintainer covering the repository in question can remove the
committer by sending an email to the openswitch-dev mailing list indicating
the person's committer rights are removed.
