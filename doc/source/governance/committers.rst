OpenHalon Committers
====================

Code Merge Responsibilities
===========================

While everyone is encouraged to review changes for OpenHalon repositories,
OpenHalon committers have the ability to +2/-2 and +A changes to these
repositories. This is an extra level of responsibility not to be taken
lightly. Correctly merging code requires not only understanding the code
itself, but also how the code affects things like documentation, testing,
and interactions with other projects. It also means you pay attention to
release milestones and understand if a patch you're merging is marked for
the release, especially critical during the feature freeze near a release.

The bottom line here is merging code is a responsibility for all OpenHalon
committers.

Adding or Removing Committers
-----------------------------

A new OpenHalon committer may be proposed at anytime on the openhalon-dev
mailing list. Typically, the existing committer team for a project will
propose a new member after discussions with the existing committers. Once
a proposal has been made, three existing OpenHalon committers must respond
to the email with a +1.  If the member is being added to a committer team
with less than three members, a simple majority will be used to determine if
the vote is successful. Another OpenHalon committer can vote -1 to veto the
proposed new OpenHalon committer.

Removal of an OpenHalon committer can happen after consultation with the
existing committers. Typically, if someone is no longer involved in working
on code in a specific repository, it is natural for that person to ask for
themselves to be removed. However, if the person has either lost contact
with the existing committers, or the existing committers determine the
person should no longer have committer rights, either the OpenHalon project
leader or the maintainer covering the repository in question can remove the
committer by sending an email to the openhalon-dev mailing list indicating
the person's committer rights are removed.
